    ..code can we not release for security or other reasons?

    How are we going to ensure that code is not part of anything we release?
    
    ..license will we release under?


How

Where

    ...can respond to the issue queue?

    recommendation: 

    Come up with a stock trolling response. "This issue queue is for questions or comments related to the content of this repository.  To comment on matters of policy or agency activities not related to this code, please use our public comment form at ....."

    Allow developers to respond in the queues to trolls or substantive issues. For other issues, have a point of contact at the agency that developers can enlist to respond
